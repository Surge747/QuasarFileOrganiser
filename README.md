# QuasarFileOrganiser
The idea is to build a file organiser for windows that uses AI to intelligently put your files in places
After defining certain "Inflow" folders where files keep being made and are cluttered like downloads, documents etc
and assigning outflow folders where files should be sorted into or in folders inside them
It uses download location, file name and properties, content to intelligently sort them to an area using an API of chatgpt

Im currently working on the UI and the project is in progress
